You wake up in a mirthy putrid bath of your own making.
Your uncomfortable spring mattress has soaked to the floorboards with remnants 
of all those poor decisions you made earlier in life.
An unshakeable headache takes your mind off all the coughing and hacking,
phlegm spilling onto your t-shirt as your lungs wildly expel their contents
in a collective struggle for preservation.

You reach out to your bedside table, hit the SNOOZE button,
and grasp the half-drunk, flat, leftover can of beer from the morning before.
The television is still on, its glow more comforting to you now than at any point
during your childhood.

What channel is on?

You’re an absolutely normal, run-of-the-mill, average adult American who spends all
night watching cartoon programming marketed to small children, and all day updating a
blog enthusiastically discussing your level of commitment to

Although your friends are reluctant to tell you to your face, throughout your entire
life most people have regarded you as a racist. 
It doesn’t help that in all your spare time, you are glued to cruel foreign game-shows
where the contestants are urged to subject themselves to humiliating circumstances,
perform sadistic tasks to each other, and in at least two cases by your count, die. 

Your ears perk to the audience’s raucous chants, “REKT MATE! REKT MATE!” a spectacle
whose apex you surely have missed, simply because you were too lazy to open your eyes. 

You could open your eyes now.

  #Open
    Congratulations, you opened your eyes.
    
    Unfortunately they are too crusty and chapped to provide any real visual information,
    but your powerful imagination conjures a breathtaking monochrome silhouette of Matty Plunda,
    the cherub cheeked host of ‘Rekt Mate: Frowns Down Unda,’ free of charge.

  #Just a few more minutes
    Congratulations, you’re still lazy. 
    
    Unfortunately, your philosophy on life also dictates you may only open your eyes a
    finite number of times, so you existentially brood over what may be the last time
    you can ever see anything.
    
    You have wasted what little time you could have spent gazing upon a breathtaking close-up
    shot of Matty Plunda, the cherub cheeked host of ‘Rekt Mate: Frowns Down Unda,” and
    your cable bill just went up last month.

“Ay!” The crowd quiets down, “Welcam t’Rekt Mate! Round’m up ‘n can ya ‘ear ‘em?”
Matty Plunda’s accent is as garbled as your reception, “Y’ los’ yer bloody mind? Bahrt,
ain’t’n ev’n any f’rthah, roun’th clock, we got ‘em, ‘ere right on Brisbane’s neetwahrk!” 
He might as well be speaking another language, because you have never understood more than
two or three words, and he just keeps going and going. 

Matty laughs and turns to the contestant behind him, who is tied to some kind of reclining easy chair.
The contestant appears ethnically divergent, and is holding a beer can, transfixed on the
small television set in front of him.

You feel a surge of anger.

    “Blimey,” you sputter malevolently, “these days they even let the chromey blokes on

Your dreams take you further than your morals.
You blow a snot-rocket onto the gazelle-skin rug beside your bed, without opening your eyes.
The TV blares some intolerable whining animal, a noise like a thousand cigarette-ravaged
cave-teenagers from Mississippi vying vocally but uncreatively for someone to give them a “car”.

Something something crows etc foreshadowing.

As you step onto the rug you feel a crusty exfoliant scrape your soles, a ghost of snot-rockets past.
