f: put unexplained plot points
f: and then try to explain them with other pages
c: then you can go in later and add spots for variables to modify
c: yeah
c: so would it be helpful to like, if you were writing out an ending
c: replace proper nouns with somehting like '$name' or something
c: i guess i will just start writing at some point and figure it out
f: yeah
f: i think we can do that stuff later if we need to
f: probably the hardest part is getting enough pages to make it fun
f: the rest is just procedural
c: haha i slept in my car for 4 hours after my math class
c is now Online.
c: ive got to type it out but i spent all math class writing an opening scene where you wake up and fall out of bed, and theres three different ways you land on the floor - two of which injure you, one of which your finger becomes lodged in your nose for several chapters
f: good one
f: feel free to make my stuff funnier
f: i think i think my stuff is funnier than most people think
c: the tv is on and one of four channels has been playing all night - a foreign gameshow channel, a children's network, sports channel, or a history documentary  channel
c: i only read the one you linked did you write other stuff?
f: i added some new stuff to it
f: it's just notes i wanted to get down
c: i really like the loose verbage
c: spitooning definitely illustrates what could happen to a viscous fluid
f: i could change it from "spittoons of blood erupt" to "blood spittoons"
f: i wasn't sure if that would be too loose
f: it would probably flow better
c: the children's show network there's a crowd chanting "BO-KAY-KAY! BO-KAY-KAY!" and an entourage of purple six breasted women are dancing around a strange octopus mascot with a giant bison head
c: the foreign gameshow channel there is a crowd chanting "REKT-MATE! REKT-MATE!" and a small man with large blushing cheeks is feverishly mopping his brow and looks to be on the verge of tears
c: i haven't written out the other two
c: achievement - Channers actively maintain a wiki about you
f: do it
f: try to type all the notes into google docs for now and once we have enough to put some structure to it we can start transitioning over to git
c: okay sweet
c: but yeah if we make it a dual narrative the television channels allow the player to describe the arch nemesis the player will control
c: JUST PLAYIN SHARK GAME NOW THO
f: ok i changed the beginning of the spittoons paragraph
f: Blood spittoons from your feet, so forcefully that your body does a quarter-pinwheel in place,
f: Blood spittoons from your feet, so forcefully that you quarter-pinwheel in place, your face thunching to stability on the exposed corner of the kitchen median cupboards.
c: what's another good channel an idiot would watch that can have a chant associated with it
c: it's all about the chant every channel has to have a crowd of people chanting something
c: i guess sports it has to be sports
f: yess
f: mma boyee
f: muay thai nemesis?
c: oh each channel would have a couple of descriptive choices
f: sick
c: so yeah you could end up with a deer moose platypus mascot for the children's gameshow
c: or a muay thai kickboxer or a basketball guy or a football guy
c: i need to figure out exactly how complex the television needs to make this haha
f: what are some different attributes
c: Gullible
f: oh good
c: Oafish
c: Clumsy
c: Ignorant
f: Tasteless
c: Temper ranges from Frothing to Slack-Jawed
f: what's an adjective that describes a poor engineer
c: what is the context
f: well i wanna make it so you can design this machine
f: and based on the attributes it comes out in different forms at different times
f: so if you're "tasteless" you cover it in crow feathers
f: or if you're a bad engineer it sucks in and masticates any crows that try to get their rewards
f: the machine trains crows to do tasks in exchange for nuts
f: something like "butterrfingers"
c: read my foreign gameshow
c: oh so like a word for an achievemnt thing or like in the narrative itself
c: it could be the oafish stat
f: yeah that makes sense
f: clumsy seems too cloase to oafish
f: close
c: i think you're right
f: maybe have those on a spectrum
c: oafish encompasses clumsiness, and like an unwillingness to work around that
f: and also one from "gullible" to "ignorant"
c: like if you're really oafish, you're super clumsy and maybe good natured, but you're going to fuck things up because you keep trying way too hard and overexerting yourself to a point where everything becomes ruined
f: ok then the opposite of that would be to be paralyzed with inaction
f: at all times
c: if your temper rating is too high you could have a little reminder somewhere like "You are in a public place, literally having a tantrum!"
c: if you get your tantrum rating to 9, the next chapter is automatically just "You are having a tantrum!!!!"
c: temper rating
f: lol
f: it's like you reach power level 9000 and go super saiyan
f: i'm going to a thing tomorrow where it's just 15 poeple in a room together, writing silently for 2 hours
f: no talking or facebook etc allowed
c: the majority of achievements should be just lines from john lennon's Imagine
c: i wonder if that's funny i might just be high
c: i like how google docs thinks rekt and unda are real words, but plunda is not
c: i think somewhere in the beginning there should be a one off character who tells you something mystical like "find the eight golden dang-dangs scattered throughout the lands..." and then he disappears but theres no dang-dangs anywhere
c: or you find all eight at once at the end
